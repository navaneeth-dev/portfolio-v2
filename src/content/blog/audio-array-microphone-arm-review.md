So I am preparing for internships for the summer and wanted to make my setup perfect and was looking into microphone arms for my blue yeti. Suprisingly there are very little budget ones avaiable in India.

So this blog is about my journey.

First I bought Maono AU-B01 which was supposed to be compitable with blue yeti but has a known issue of not recieving parts. And as expected I recieved only the arm part.
Then I asked Amazon for replacement and bought the second one Audio Array for 2k. The packaging was excellent but the 5/8" screw was not an exact fit for Blue yeti so I took the Maono's one and its perfect now.

## Conclusion

Buy the Maono and check if you get all the parts then no problem, if you dont take the 5/8" adapter and buy audio array and replace it.

In summary, if you're looking for a microphone arm that is built to last, easy to use and has great adjustability, the Audio Array Microphone Arm is a great option for your Blue Yeti. It has a great build quality, durable materials, and a versatile design that makes it easy to adjust the microphone's position for the best possible recording.
